Project Title: Sentiment Analysis for Political Leaders

Project Description: This project is about political leaders in Turkey. Sentiment analysis is very important for political leaders. Because they want to learn what people think about them. Therefore I will develop a software using python programming language and natural language processing tools. I will use twitter data in my project.Firstly I will take tweets from Twitter (www.twitter.com) using Twitter API. In this site a user comment for each political leaders, stating his/her general opinion about the leaders especially with a related icon (positive, neutral, negative). I will gather all the data from related hashtags  of the site. I'll do the analysis of data using the techniques of sentiment analysis. After that I want to show results as charts.
