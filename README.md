The aim of this project is sentiment analysis about political leaders in social media. So I will develop a software using python programming language and natural language processing tools. I will use twitter data in my project. Firstly I will take tweets from Twitter (www.twitter.com) using Twitter API. In this site a user comment for each political leaders, stating his/her general opinion about the leaders especially with a related icon (positive, neutral, negative). I will gather all the data from related hash tags  of the site. I'll do the analysis of data using the techniques of sentiment analysis. After that I want to show results as charts.
