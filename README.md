**Project Description:** 
     This project is about political leaders in Turkey. Sentiment analysis is very important for political leaders  because they want to know what people think about them. The aim of this project is sentiment analysis about political leaders in social media. So I will develop a software using python programming language and natural language processing tools. I will use twitter data in my project. Firstly I will take tweets from [Twitter](www.twitter.com) using Twitter API. In this site a user comment for each political leaders, stating his/her general opinion about the leaders especially with a related icon (positive, neutral, negative). I will gather all the data from related hash tags  of the site. I'll do the analysis of data using the techniques of sentiment analysis. After that I want to show results as charts.
